## Description
Inspired by the capabilities of [duckdb-wasm](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm) and [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), we wanted to address the growing demand for efficient handling of large tabular datasets. This grid leverages browser-side rendering, enabling fast computation and seamless user interactions with big data directly in the web environment.

## DuckDB-Grid Features
### 🐤 Try dropping your CSV or XLSX files

### 🐤 Grouping
- Drag the columns to "Row Groups" of the sidebar on the left.
- Numeric columns automatically get "sum"ed up. (Can also change the value aggregation to max/min/...)
