## Description

Inspired by the capabilities of [duckdb-wasm](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm) and [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), we wanted to address the growing demand for efficient handling of large tabular datasets. This grid leverages browser-side rendering, enabling fast computation and seamless user interactions with big data directly in the web environment.
